Our team aims at improving the individualized experiences of customers in TD Asset Management with technology, ending up with a portfolio involving risk/reward most matching with the customers' needs. Our ultimate goal is to get a sense of the customers' personality, risk acceptance, and their fitting portfolio before getting in touch with them; therefore, conversations with customers that ensue this process would be more smooth and efficient.

We want to build a system, culminating in a website, that gathers customer insights from various data sources, selectively present these data, and come up with an investment strategy.

In the past 36 hours, we have made satisfying progress but also met constraints regarding time and the amount of data we can find. We will do more research to calculate more exactly how certain traits lead to risk acceptance, further explore data sources, especially in finding out fixed expenses of customers, and better define and narrow down the type of customers that this model fits.
